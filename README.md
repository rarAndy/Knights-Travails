# Knights-Travails

Knights Travails is a tangent to the shortest path problem, where a chess knight must find the shortest path from any position on the board to a selected target. This implementation uses breadth-first search and an option to increase the board size, up to 50 x 50. Try the demo [here](https://github.com/rarAndy/Knights-Travails).
